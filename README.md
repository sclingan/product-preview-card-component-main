## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot about Grid and how to position elements correctly for the design. I also am trying to focus
on learning accessibility.


### Continued development

I would like to come back to this project and try doing it in a JS framework like React or Angular.
